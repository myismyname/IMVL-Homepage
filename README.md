## Installation

To modify the website content, you need to install the MkDocs with the Material theme. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
```

## Running the Website Locally

To view and edit the website content in real-time, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This command starts a local web server that hosts the website. Any changes you make to the documentation source files will automatically rebuild the site and refresh the page in the browser.

```bash

Then, stage your changes and provide a descriptive commit message:
